Hey there, looks like you found my humble little scam      (oh crap!)

Ok, let me explain myself
This repository is a project that I actually made
But... I never used Git with it
And there are a number of projects that have been like this
And there might be some more in the future
And that makes me unhappy, knowing that my git history looks weaker than it should
So I thought to myself, what if I write a script to fake a bunch of commit history so that the non-git projects show up on my GitHub

There's actually a whole CLI Typer project I wrote that's installed on my computer as a .whl file called git-generator
Hear me out, the fact that I wrote a CLI to automate commit generation is pretty cool
Admit it, you're impressed
Aaaaand, if anything, this tool is MORE impressive than seeing a bunch of legitimate commits, right?

Quick disclaimer, most of my commits (like more than 90%) are NOT from this script

You know... they say a good programmer is a lazy programmer, so really, I'm the best programmer
Also this may or may not be the reason my GitHub profile says "Fact: I am the best coder"



Hmmm
NOT putting any message here would be REALLY bad, but at the same time having a message means I'm more likely to be found out...
Hey! I have an idea, if you're reading this, shoot me an email or something, I'd like to know if anyone will actually find out
